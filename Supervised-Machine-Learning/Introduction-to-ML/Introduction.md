## 📘 **Module 1 – Week 1: Introduction to Machine Learning**

---

## 1️⃣ What is Machine Learning?

**Formal Definition (Arthur Samuel):**

> *Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.*

**Modern Interpretation:**
Machine Learning enables computers to:

* Learn patterns from data
* Improve performance with experience
* Make predictions or decisions automatically

### ✨ Why Machine Learning?

Traditional programming fails when:

* Rules are too complex (e.g., speech recognition)
* Data patterns change over time
* Explicit logic is hard to define

Machine Learning solves these by **learning directly from data**.

## 2️⃣ Types of Machine Learning

### 🔹 Supervised Learning (Main focus of Week 1)

Supervised learning uses **labeled data**, meaning:

* Each training example has an **input (x)** and a **correct output (y)**

#### General Goal:

Learn a function that maps input → output accurately for **new, unseen data**.

### 🔸 Types of Supervised Learning

#### ✅ A. Regression

* Output is **continuous**
* Examples:

  * Predicting house prices
  * Forecasting temperature
  * Estimating stock value

#### ✅ B. Classification

* Output is **discrete / categorical**
* Examples:

  * Email spam detection
  * Disease diagnosis (yes/no)
  * Image recognition (cat/dog)

### 🔹 Unsupervised Learning (Introductory idea)

* Uses **unlabeled data**
* Finds hidden patterns or structures
* Example:

  * Customer segmentation
  * Clustering similar news articles

*(Unsupervised learning is covered in later modules.)*

## 3️⃣ Machine Learning Workflow (Big Picture)

1. Collect data
2. Choose a model
3. Train the model
4. Evaluate performance
5. Use the model for prediction

Week 1 focuses mainly on **steps 2 and 3**.

---

## 4️⃣ Model Representation (Hypothesis Function)

A **model** is represented using a **hypothesis function**.

### Example: Linear Regression (Single Variable)

[
h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x
]

Where:

* ( x ) = input feature
* ( \theta_0 ) = intercept
* ( \theta_1 ) = slope
* ( h_\theta(x) ) = predicted output

📌 The goal of learning is to find the **best values of θ₀ and θ₁**.

---

## 5️⃣ Training Data & Notation

* ( m ) → number of training examples
* ( (x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) ) → i-th training example
* ( X ) → input features
* ( y ) → output values

This notation is used throughout the course.

---

## 6️⃣ Cost Function (Error Measurement)

To know *how good* a model is, we define a **cost function**.

### Mean Squared Error (MSE)

[
J(\theta_0,\theta_1) = \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2
]

### Purpose:

* Measures prediction error
* Lower value ⇒ better model
* Squaring penalizes large errors

📌 **Learning = minimizing the cost function**

---

## 7️⃣ Gradient Descent (Optimization Concept)

Gradient Descent is an **iterative algorithm** used to minimize the cost function.

### Update Rule:

[
\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} J(\theta)
]

Where:

* ( \alpha ) = learning rate
* Controls step size

### Intuition:

* Move parameters downhill
* Stop at minimum cost

## 8️⃣ Learning Rate (α)

* **Too small** → very slow learning
* **Too large** → may overshoot minimum

Choosing α correctly is critical.

## 9️⃣ Applications of Supervised Learning (Week 1 Examples)

| Domain      | Example                |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Real Estate | House price prediction |
| Healthcare  | Disease diagnosis      |
| Finance     | Credit scoring         |
| Email       | Spam filtering         |
| Vision      | Image classification   |

## 🔑 Key Takeaways (Exam-Oriented)

* Machine Learning learns from data, not rules
* Supervised learning uses labeled data
* Regression predicts continuous values
* Classification predicts categories
* Hypothesis represents the model
* Cost function measures error
* Gradient descent minimizes cost
